                </h3>
                <h3>The Telugu film Godfather, starring Chiranjeevi, Nayanthara, Satyadev Kancharana and Salman Khan in a guest appearance, is director Mohan Raja’s eighth remake. The director is aware that the source material, Malayalam film Lucifer starring Mohanlal, was an unabashed fanboy tribute to the star by actor-director Prithviraj Sukumaran. Mohan Raja takes the broad outline of Lucifer along with some of its key portions and does a fanboy tribute to Chiranjeevi. Godfather is shorter (157 minutes) than Lucifer (174 minutes) and also unapologetic about pandering to the lead actor’s fan base.
