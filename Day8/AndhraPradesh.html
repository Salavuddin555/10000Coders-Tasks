            <h1>Andhra Pradesh: </h1>
            <h3 class="blue">  ‘Jagan stubbornly pursuing three capitals to the detriment of Amaravati farmers’</h3>
            <h3>Chief Minister exploring all options to avoid implementation of the High Court verdict, says TDP leader</h3>
            <h3>Telugu Desam Party (TDP) Polit Bureau member Nakka Ananda Babu has alleged that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is exploring all options to avoid implementation of the Andhra Pradesh High Court verdict on the three capitals.</h3>
            <h3>It was in furtherance of this agenda that Ministers such as Botcha Satyanarayana and Dharmana Prasada Rao unleashed a malicious propaganda against the capital region farmers’ Amaravati to Arasavalli Maha Padayatra, Mr. Ananda Babu alleged while addressing the media at the party central office near Mangalagiri on Saturday.</h3>
            <h3>Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had endorsed the idea of developing a greenfield capital city in Amaravati when he was in the Opposition, but went on to change his stand later as per his convenience, due to which the State was suffering an irreparable loss, he alleged.</h3>
            <h2>Court verdict</h2>
            <h3>Mr. Anand Babu said despite the court verdict that the State had no legislative competence to split or shift the capital, the Chief Minister was stubborn in his pursuit of decentralisation to the detriment of thousands of farmers who had parted with their arable lands for the development of Amaravati.</h3>
            <h3>The moving of a Constitution Amendment Bill in Rajya Sabha by YSRCP member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy for “provision of explicit legislative competence to the State Legislatures to establish one or more capitals within their territories” proved that the State cannot decide on the issue of capital city.</h3>
            <h3>The State government had recently filed an Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court challenging the impugned judgment of the High Court.</h3>
