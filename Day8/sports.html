                <p>South Africa cricketer David Miller is going through a tough time currently as his close friend's daughter, Ane, passed away on Saturday (October 8). The cricketer is currently in India and is featuring in the ongoing ODI series against the home team. Ahead of the second ODI in Ranchi, Miller took to his official Instagram account to express his grief over her death.

                </p>
                <p>Miller posted a video of having spent some precious moments with her. Ane, on some occasions, was also spotted at the stadiums and in the video, it was seen that the left-hander had taken her into the stadiums as well after the matches. While many thought she was Miller's daughter, it has been confirmed that she is the cricketer's close friend's daughter.

                <p>"Going to miss you so much my skut! The biggest heart I've ever known. You took fighting to a different level - always incredibly positive and a smile on your face. A cheeky and mischeivous side to you. You embrace every person and evety challenge in your journey. You taught me so much about cherishing every single moment in life. I feel humbled to have walked a journey with you. I love you so much! RIP," Miller wrote in his story.
